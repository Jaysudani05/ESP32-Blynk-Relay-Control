# ESP32 Blynk Relay Control System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **WiFi-based relay control system** using an **ESP32 DevKit V4**. Four relays are controlled using **push buttons** and can also be integrated with the **Blynk IoT platform** for remote operation. The system is designed for **home automation** and **IoT-based device control**.

The project is simulated and tested using **Wokwi**, allowing virtual hardware testing without physical components.

## ⚙️ Working Explanation
1. The **ESP32** is powered and connected to the circuit.  
2. Each **push button** is connected to a specific GPIO pin of the ESP32.  
3. When a button is pressed:  
   - ESP32 detects the input signal.  
   - The corresponding GPIO output pin changes state.  
   - The connected relay is activated (ON/OFF).  
4. Each relay controls a load (LED in simulation).  
5. Using the **Blynk app**, the same relays can be controlled remotely over WiFi.  
6. This enables both **manual** and **remote IoT-based control** of devices.
